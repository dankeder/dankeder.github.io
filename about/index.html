<p>
I am a freelance software developer/architect with over 8 years of experience in SW
development, infrastructure and Linux system administration. I can work with
several programming languages and I have an extensive Linux and UNIX system
administration skillset.
</p>

<p>
I'm always striving to find systematic and long-term solutions to technical
problems instead of working around the real problems. You can find more
information about what I do at
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keder">LinkedIn</a>
or at <a href="https://github.com/dankeder">GitHub</a>.
