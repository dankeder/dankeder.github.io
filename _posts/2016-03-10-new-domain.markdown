I decided to move this site to a new domain
[dankeder.com](https://dankeder.com/). In case you have my old domain
(keder.me) in bookmarks or in the feed reader please change it to
[dankeder.com](https://dankeder.com/).

From time to time, this site also serves as a "guinea pig" for some of my
experiments. As a result, from now on it is served by
[CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com/), it is HTTPS-only and even its DNS records
are secured by DNSSEC &ndash; not even some banks have this, right?

I also revamped the title page to be more "[professional]({{ site.url }})".
Check it out if you are looking for a freelancing "DevOps engineer". Who knows, we might
end up working together.
