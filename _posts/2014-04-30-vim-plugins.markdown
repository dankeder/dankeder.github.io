YouCompleteMe
-------------

[YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) is a fast auto-completion engine with support for many programming
languages (C/C++, Python, Ruby, PHP, ...).


CtrlP
-----

[CtrlP](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) is a fuzzy file finder that makes opening new files a breeze.

For those that want to open the file in a new tab instead of the current one
[here's the magic that does that](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/issues/160).


Airline
-------

[Airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline) will prettify the vim status bar. It does similar things as the Powerline plugin but
is more lightweight.


Tagbar
------

[Tagbar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar) provides a sidebar for browsing tags of the source code files,
ordered by the scope.


Closetag
--------

[Closetag](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=13) is a plugin for closing HTML tags.


HiCursorWords
-------------

[HiCursorWords](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4306) highlights other occurences of the word under the cursor without searching for
it. Very useful when searching for other occurences of a variable or function.
