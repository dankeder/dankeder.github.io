A couple of months ago I was on a conference in Berlin (IIRC it was [Erlang
Factory](http://www.erlang-factory.com/)). After that much time, almost everything I
saw there has already evaporated out of my mind. Except one thing, that has been
lingering in the back of my mind since then. It's a quote from the presentation
of Robert Virding, one of the designers of the Erlang language:

> Build tools, not solutions.

<!--more-->

Solutions are single-purpose - they usually only solve one problem (or one instance
of the problem), and that's it. If you want to solve something similar, you have
to get (and pay for) a new "solution". Tools are more universal - they are
flexible enough to be used in unexpected ways, many of which were not
anticipated by the author.
