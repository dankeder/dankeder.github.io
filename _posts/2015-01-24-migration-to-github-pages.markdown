I decided to move this little blog of mine to [GitHub
Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-github-pages/). Using git to
manage blog posts it is a lot more appealing to me than copy-pasting stuff to
Tumblr.

If you use a RSS reader, please update [the feed URL](https://dankeder.com/feed.xml).
I would gladly set up a redirect, but GitHub Pages doesn't support them. Sorry
for the inconvenience.
